Lightweight and ultra-lightweight ciphers usually offer 80 to 128 bit security [12]. 80 bit security is considered adequate for constrained devices [23], like 4-bit micro-controllers and RFID tags, while 128 bits is typical for mainstream applications [1]. For one way authentication, 64 to 80 bit security would suffice [21].Three main approaches are followed in implementing lightweight ciphers. In the first case, researchers try to improve the performance of well-known and well-studied ciphers such as AES and DES. A state of the art AES [1] hardware implementation uses 2400 GE and is used as a benchmark for newer ciphers. In the second case, re-searchers design and implement new ciphers, specific for this domain. PRESENT [2] is such an example implemented for lightweight and ultra-lightweight cryptography and is one of the first ciphers that offer a 1000 GE implementation for ultra-constrained devices. In the third case, researchers mix features of several ciphers that are well studied and their individual properties are known. The absence of decryption is another factor that can reduce the requirements of such ciphers, especially for ultra-lightweight cryptography. Hummingbird-2 [13] is a combination of cipher and protocol and adopts this strategy. This 4 approach is suitable for devices that need only one way authentication. Furthermore, some ciphers like KTANTAN [14] propose that the key should be hard-wired on the device to further reduce the GE due to the absence of key generation operations. Block Ciphers. DES [15] is a traditional block cipher that can be used in constrained devices al-though due to its small key sizes, the security level is low. DESL is a lightweight version of the cipher that achieves 20% size reduction, DESX uses key whitening to increase the security level, while DESXL is the combination of the two variants [15]. Other traditional ciphers that are investigated in this field are AES [1], Camellia [62], CLEFIA [16] and IDEA [51]. Camellia is approved for use by the ISO/IEC and the projects NESSIE and CRYPTREC. The hardware implementation exceeds the 3000 GE bound while the software implementation is fast. CLEFIA is a 128-bit block size cipher and uses 128-, 192- and 256-bits keys. It was designed by SONY and is highly efficient both in hardware and software. It is standardized in ISO 29192-2. IDEA is used in PGP v2.0 and performs well in embedded software. PRESENT [12] is a milestone in LWC and the comparison unit for lightweight ciphers. It is 128-bit block size cipher and uses 80- and 128-bits keys. It is standardized in ISO 29192-2 and is efficient in both hardware and software. PRESENT’s novelties include the replacement of 8 distinct S-Boxes with a carefully selected single one and a fully wired diffusion layer without any algebraic unit. Hummingbird-2 [13] is a promising ultra-lightweight cipher with a hybrid structure of block and stream cipher. It can optionally produce a message authentication code (MAC) for each message processed and form a one way authentication protocol. It encrypts data in high rates and its performance is better than PRESENT’s. Two main drawbacks are the initialization process and the decryption function. In more detail, an initialization process is necessary before en/decryption for its stream property and, moreover, the performance decreases if many small messages are processed. Also, the encryption and decryption operations are different, therefore the en/decryption implementation is 70% larger than the encryption-only version. The KATAN and KTANTAN family [14] produces low hardware footprint. KATAN uses a very simple key schedule mechanism and achieves 802 GE. KTANTAN is proposed for devices where the key is initialized once and remains unchanged, achieving 462 GE. SEA [17] supports a scalable software implementation with low-cost encryption routines. It is parameterized in text, key, and processor size and can produce low memory requirements, small code size and a limited instruction set. Newer lightweight block ciphers include TWINE [18], Klein [21], LED [20], LBlock [19], PUFFIN-2 [22], Piccolo [23], NOEKEON [51] and ITUbee [53]. TWINE, Klein, LED and LBlock balance tradeoffs between hardware and software implementations. TWINE achieves a good overall status as PRESENT. 5 PUFFIN-2 is faster and more lightweight in hardware than PRESENT for en/decryption implementations. Piccolo is the most lightweight block cipher in hardware and it requires 683 and 758 GE for 80 and 128 bit key size respectively. NOEKEON is reported in LWC for its compact and efficient software implementation. ITUbee is designed for lightweight software and achieves the best overall status in this domain. SIMON and SPECK [54] have been designed by NSA. Although the ciphers are not publicly released, a performance evaluation was presented during the MIT 2013 Legal Hack-a-Thone. Both ciphers perform well in software and hardware. SIMON is better in hardware and SPECK is better in software. Nevertheless, Piccolo and ITUbee achieve a better overall status in hardware and software respectively. Furthermore, domain specific ciphers include EPCBC [24] and PRINTcipher [25]. EPCBC is based on PRESENT and targets in Electronic Product Code (EPC) encryption applications. EPC aims to replace bar codes with low-cost passive RFIDS and is an industry standard by EPCglobal. PRINTcipher targets EPC and Integrated Circuit (IC) printing (i.e. used for the production and personalization of circuits).
